					<h4>Work</h4>
					<b>Software Engineer</b><br/>
					<small class="text-muted">The Walt Disney Company</small>
					<p class="text-justify">As a Software Engineer on the Customer Solutions team, I support customer use of and development of Disney's enterprise software. I specifically support Disney's Content Management Systems (CMS), software designed for high availability and high performance in order to meet the diverse needs of Disney's subsidiaries. I provide support options to meet the tactical needs of my customers' businesses, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Troubleshooting and investigating issues with Java services running in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud</li>
						<li>Production support and bug fixes for the CMS</li>
						<li>Development of tools for provisioning and administration of the CMS, including python scripts</li>
						<li>Software upgrades, installation, documentation, and training</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Software Engineer</b><br/>
					<small class="text-muted">The Boeing Company</small>
					<p class="text-justify">I worked on the Real Time Simulation (RTS) Training Systems team. My team developed software simulations of many of the sensors and other systems on a real airplane for operator training in a lab. My work with the RTS team is where I developed my favorite open ended interview question: What could be different between a local/dev system and a production environment? During my relatively brief time in this position, I was responsible for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Software upgrades, unit testing, and integration testing</li>
						<li>Deploying, testing, and fixing oursoftware in a customer's production lab environment</li>
						<li>Creating testing and upgrade documentation</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Electrical Engineer</b><br/>
					<small class="text-muted">The Boeing Company</small>
					<p class="text-justify">I worked as an equipment owner for one of Boeings defense programs. In this paper-focused position, I created, reviewed, and released supplier contract and FAA documents for my four avionics communications subsystems. I also created and maintained records for the entire avionics subsystem (flight deck and communications.) Records included 2000+ equipment items in the systems engineering database, and functional diagrams and descriptions for approximately 35 systems.</p>
					<p class="text-justify">As a member of the Employee Engagement Team, I organized a variety of activities for my program. I started the Employee of Month recognition, where employees could nominate their coworkers for outstanding work on the program. I also planned, advertised, and ran monthly courses where a senior member of the program would give a half-hour technical talk to teach other team members about their development area. I assisted in organizing bi-monthly themed events, including a summer BBQ and a Halloween potluck and costume competition.</p>
					<b>Computer Engineer Intern</b><br/>
					<small class="text-muted">The Boeing Company</small>
					<p class="text-justify">I interned with Boeing after my junior year of college. My intern project was to determine if commercially available hardware would be able to handle our data load, fault tolerance, and availability needs. I researched and performed hardware throughput and latency tests on multiple data storage systems, then analyzed the performance tests and determined which configurations met requirements. At the end of the internship, I prepared a report and presentation on the results of my tests.</p>
